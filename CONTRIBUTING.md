## Auto labelling

The PR template contains a section that looks something like this:

```
<!--

Please check the checkboxes below for any labels you want assigned to the PR:

- [ ] WIP
- [ ] Ready for review
- [ ] Needs testing

-->
```

If you check one of these boxes the corresponding label will automatically be applied to the PR by our bot. For example ticking "WIP" will assign the "WIP: Building" label:


```
- [x] WIP
```

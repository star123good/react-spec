## What is it?
---

A single place for all the best communities.

## Who is it for?

Nerds, initially (Spec, TeamSketch, Designer Hangout, PixelFireplace, etc...), but expand to pop culture and beyond through that community.

## Why should communities use Spectrum over (Slack/Facebook Groups + Messenger/Twitter DMs/etc)?
---

- Free public communities
- Free private communities for 503(c) non-profits and educational groups?
- Code of Conduct moderation
- No ads
- Formatted for focused conversations, not static posts or ongoing randomness.

## How does it make money?
---
- Paid private communities for internal chat
- Brand tools

# Spectrum

Spectrum is a project to create an open community for designers and developers. We believe the best way to accomplish that is to have a diverse set of people create it.

This document is open to change, but as of 07/04/16, the core ideas are:

1. A strong community is diverse and is well-moderated according to a consistent set of guidelines to ensure that people feel comfortable engaging.

2. Comment-based communities tend to become toxic the fastest.
  - The inherent "static-ness" of a comment sets people up to argue without asking for clarification first, unlike a real-time chat system where replies are expected.

3. The Spec community of designers and developers has outgrown Slack and should also be more welcoming to newcomers.
  - Slack requires you to sign up before you can even see the content which is a significant barrier with no upside.

The team at Spec Network, Inc. will make up the core contributor group and have approvals on pull requests and scope for the time being (with other key contributors being added over time). 

We'll work to make sure that whatever form Spectrum takes is sustainable, focused, and remains constructive.

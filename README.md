# Spectrum

## What is it?
A single, unified place for all the best communities.


## Who is it for?
Nerds, initially (Spec, TeamSketch, Zeit, Framer, Figma, etc...), but expand to pop culture and beyond through that community.


## Why should communities use Spectrum over (Slack/Facebook Groups + Messenger/Twitter DMs/etc)?
- Free public communities
- Purpose-built for communities first
- Search engine indexable communities
- Code of Conduct + moderation tools
- No advertising
- Threaded Live Chat supports async + synchronous conversation easily.


## How does it make money?
- Paid communities (10Â¢ / member / mo)
  They get:
  - Unlimited private channels
  - Unlimited moderators
  - Slack team / FB group import
  - Statistics
  - Pinned posts
  - Brand tools
    - Subdomain
    - Custom theming
  - Privacy controls
  - Custom post types?
  - Story tags for organization?
  - Custom emoji/stickers? (a la Twitch, YouTube, Slack)
  - Unlimited file history? (depending on our data retention policies generally)

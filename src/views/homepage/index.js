                  We could do things like:
                  - manually insert a first "fake" search result saying something like "Your community here - create one now"
                  - also feels pretty powerful if someone were to search for themselves or search for a community they want to start, and probably find a null state, and we have a really compelling cta to create a communty from that search query
